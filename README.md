# Event Monitor

## What it does?

It displays events from meetup.com (currently for hs3city and elixir-meetup).

## How to start it?

`npm start`
That's it!

App will be accessible on 'localhost:3000/app'.

Use nvm to set your node version if it is not working.

## DOCKER!

You can run it via: 
docker run -P psuwala/event-display:1.0.0
OR
docker run -p3000:3000 psuwala/event-display:1.0.0
